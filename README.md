# TensorFlow Deep Learning Study

### Tensorflow is an end to end platform to perform machine learning and deep learning task that allows to find patterns in the data. 
It helps to predict uncovered, hidden and new patterns in the data which can be used to decide future planning, strategies and actions.

# What we will be covering in this tutorial

* Tensorflow basics and fundamentals
* Preprocessing data (getting it into tensors)
* Building and using pre-trained deep learning models
* Fitting a model to the data (to learn patterns)
* Making prediction with a model (using patterns)
* Evaluating model predictions
* Saving and loading the models
* Using trained model to make predictions on custom data
